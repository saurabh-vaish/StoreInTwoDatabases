For multiple datasources we need to configure it manually . In this example mysql and postgre are used as two different datasources.
steps :-
    1. create model classes and repos in different packgs according to their datasources
    2. create properties file with keys of driver class name , url , username , password for both the datasources with different names.
    3. Similarly make hibernate properties with dialect for both the data-sources.
    4. Define two configuration classes for both the data-sources.
    5. Data-source configuration ------

   --- make a classes annotated with @Configuration , @ EnableTransactionManagement and
    @EnableJpaRepositories(
            entityManagerFactoryRef = "name of entity manager bean",
            transactionManagerRef = "name of transaction manager bean",
            basePackages = " full package name of their corresponding repositories "
    )
   --- Define datasouce bean e.g. DriverManagerDataSource or BasicDataSource and set properties to them.
   --- use @Bean(name of bean)
   --- Define LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean(EntityManagerFactoryBuilder) and set data-source , hibernate properties , model class package and give unique persistent unit name
   --- use @Bean(name of bean)
   --- Define PlatformTransactionManager and return JpaTransactionManager
